# Advanced Machine Learning Project: Predicting Revenue

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to analyze and predict **Revenue** based on a dataset of various features, including numerical and categorical data. The goal is to build a robust predictive model using ensemble methods, perform hyperparameter tuning, and evaluate the model's performance with appropriate metrics.  

The project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using techniques like Gradient Boosting, GridSearchCV, and advanced feature transformations.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description

The dataset contains features from a business context, to predict the target variable: **Revenue**. It includes:

- **Numerical Features**: [List numerical features from your dataset]
- **Categorical Features**: [List categorical features from your dataset]

Ensure to preprocess the dataset appropriately by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.

## ðŸ’» Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and feature relationships.
- Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets (80/20 split).

### 2. Model Training
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor** as the baseline model.
- Training the model with default parameters.
- Evaluate performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score.

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Tuning parameters such as:
  - Number of estimators.
  - Learning rate.
  - Maximum depth of trees.
  - Subsampling rate.
- Using **GridSearchCV** to find the best parameters.

### 4. Final Evaluation
- Testing the best model on the test dataset.
- Report improved metrics and compare them against baseline performance.
